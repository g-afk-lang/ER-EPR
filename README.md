Before the photon's quantum spin collapses, a blocking apparatus is placed over one of the slits, and the wave does not collapse into a wave function. Emission and absorption are symmetric so atoms can't lie about how they got their energy.

So a relativistic magnetic ion so 1/2 spin at double slit, and 1/2 spin at measurement device, spin of 1 without. control: Superposition is two entangled atoms. For an opposite spin requires with and without a measurement per atom, factor in emission and absorption are symmetric, one atom flips direction to absorb energy resulting in magnetic field changes, instantly.
