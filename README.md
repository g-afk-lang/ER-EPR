Project Overview:

This project explores a theoretical setup designed to test the fundamental connection between quantum measurement, electron spin, and entanglement. The experiment is based on a modified double-slit apparatus that uses entangled electrons to investigate how a "which-path" measurement influences quantum spin and creates an observable change in a magnetic field.

Core Principles Being Tested:

This thought experiment touches on several advanced quantum concepts:

Wave-Function Collapse:

The central idea is to manipulate whether a quantum wave function collapses by selectively blocking one path in a double-slit experiment before a measurement is made.

Quantum Spin as Information:

 The experiment uses the spin of relativistic electrons (spin-1/2 particles) as the key variable. The hypothesis is that the combined spin state of an entangled pair will change depending on whether a measurement is performed.

Entanglement and Non-Locality:

The setup relies on a pair of entangled electrons in a superposition of opposite spins. The state of one electron is proposed to be instantaneously influenced by a measurement performed on the other, regardless of distance.

Symmetry in Quantum Interactions:

The principle that emission and absorption are symmetric processes is used to justify that the energy state of an atom is a true reflection of the quantum information it has received.

The Experimental Design:
 
The Source: Generate pairs of entangled electrons. These electrons are in a state of superposition, where their spins are linked but individually undefined until measured. The total spin of the pair is controlled.

The Apparatus: A double-slit setup is used for one electron of the entangled pair. A key feature is a "blocking apparatus" that can be placed over one slit to prevent the electron from passing through it.

The Measurement:

Condition A (No Measurement): One electron is sent toward the double-slit apparatus without any "which-path" information being recorded. According to the theory, its wave function does not collapse, and it maintains a spin of 1/2.

Condition B (Measurement): The blocking apparatus is used, or a detector is placed at one slit. This constitutes a "which-path" measurement.

The Control:

The second entangled electron is sent to a separate measurement device that also measures its spin.

The Hypothesis:

The theory proposes that when a which-path measurement is made on the first electron, its entangled partner will instantaneously "know" about this measurement. This will cause the spin of an atom in the second measurement device to flip, resulting in an instantaneous and measurable change in a local magnetic field. The total spin of the system would be different in the measured vs. unmeasured conditions (a spin of 1 without a which-path measurement is proposed).

What This DIY Project Involves:

The physical realization of this experiment requires equipment typical to a garage setup, this DIY project is about:

Theoretical Modeling: Developing the mathematical framework for the proposed interactions.

Thought Experimentation: Rigorously analyzing the sequence of events and predicting the outcomes based on the known laws of quantum mechanics.

Simulation: Potentially using programming to stimulate the behavior of the entangled qubits and the effect of the measurement on the system's overall state.


Breakdown: Before the electron's quantum spin collapses, a blocking apparatus is placed over one of the slits, and the wave does not collapse into a wave function. Emission and absorption are symmetric so electrons can't lie about how they got their energy. So a relativistic electron, a 1/2 spin at double slit, and 1/2 spin at measurement device, spin of 1 without. Control: Superposition is two entangled electrons. For an opposite spin requires with and without a measurement per electron, factor in emission and absorption are symmetric, one electron flips direction resulting in magnetic field changes, instantly.
