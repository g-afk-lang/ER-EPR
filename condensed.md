Electrons must be absorbed with zinc oxide powder on the floor of the bottle or they'll interfere with readouts. A modified beam splitting tube insertion with a beam forming electromagnetic coil around the bottleneck with an electromagnet and EMF sensor on either side.

If the electron accelerator is switched off and the MHz electromagnet is turned on and you don't get a concise signal, and if the electron accelerator is switched on and the MHz electromagnet is turned on and you do get a concise signal. Then ER = EPR.

The beauty is if the EMF sensor and the MHz electromagnet is close enough and a signal like a Fibonacci sequence is used, after calibration of course, then if ER = EPR then there'd be temporal cross talk.

So to apply a matrix to an echo on any two steps to describe the quantum state, send a signal to the coil drive and the qubit will return a state vector via it's time evolution, the eigenvalues through the coil drive signal represent the Bloch sphere.
