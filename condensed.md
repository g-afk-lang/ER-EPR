Electrons must be absorbed with zinc oxide powder on the floor of the bottle or they'll interfere with readouts. A modified beam splitting tube insertion with a beam forming electromagnetic coil around the bottleneck with an electromagnet and EMF sensor on either side.

If the electron accelerator is switched off and the MHz electromagnet is turned on and you don't get a concise signal, and if the electron accelerator is switched on and the MHz electromagnet is turned on and you do get a concise signal. Then ER = EPR.

The beauty is if the EMF sensor and the MHz electromagnet is close enough and a signal like a Fibonacci sequence is used, after calibration of course, then if ER = EPR then there'd be temporal cross talk.

So to apply a matrix to an echo on any two steps to describe the quantum state, send a signal to the coil drive and the qubit will return a state vector via it's time evolution, the eigenvalues through the coil drive signal represent the Bloch sphere.

So essentially, the baseline signal takes time and the ER=EPR signal does not. If the baseline signal takes 1 second to reach the sensor the ER=EPR signal gets there instantly. I suppose a T-symmetry is involved from the moment of decision. Implying reality isn't constructed before it is quantized.

If at point B is a null-lorentz conjugate of point A, point A must be negative for an observer at point B. So for observer A, something happens before their 'now' moment that isn't foreseeable and is not beyond temporal evolution negation.
