DC 3V-12V To 1000KV High Voltage Arc Generator Module (Pre Made)

Energy and Performance at 1MV
Electron Energy:

1MV gives electrons 1 MeV of kinetic energy

Electron velocity reaches approximately 59% of the speed of light

Electrons are now fully relativistic with significant penetrating power

Typical Performance:

Beam Current: Up to 200mA in continuous operation

Average Power: 10kW-1000kW depending on design

Pulse Power: Up to 40GW for pulsed systems

Penetration Depth: Several centimeters in materials, suitable for bulk processing
